"""Domain-agnostic pool-based active learning.

Works against any scikit-learn-style estimator (fit / predict / predict_proba)
and a plain numpy feature pool - nothing here knows about Chandra, X-ray
features, or class names. catalog_classification supplies the estimator,
the feature matrix, and (for the reliability-aware experiment) an auxiliary
per-example array; this module just runs the query loop.

Query strategies are plain scoring functions, higher score = more worth
labeling:

    score_fn(estimator, X_labeled, y_labeled, X_pool, pool_indices, rng) -> np.ndarray

`pool_indices` are the caller's original dataset indices for the rows
currently in X_pool (the pool shrinks as rounds proceed, so this is how a
strategy looks up per-example side information, e.g. reliability, keyed to
the original dataset rather than the current pool position).

`reliability_weighted()` wraps any base strategy with a per-example
reliability array (any domain's, not just Chandra's) and a mixing exponent
alpha - this is the method-layer contribution, not a Chandra-specific hack.
